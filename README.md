# SanFranFoodTruckSchedule
A console app built in .NET Core 2.1 which displays a list of food trucks in the San Francisco area that are currently open at the time the app is run. Data is gathered from the San Francisco government's DataSF API for Mobile Food Schedule. The API request returns data in JSON format, which is then filtered by day and hours of operation of those currently open.
