## Building as a Full Scale Web App

To build this project as a full scale web application, I would again use the .NET Core platform but this time creating a MVC Web Application instead of a console app. In a sense, I designed the console app in a similar format to a MVC app, just without the Views. The Model View Controller architecture works by way of Views (or webpages) requesting and rendering actions from the Controllers which manipulate data from the Models to display that data in the view the controller directs it to. In the console app, we have a model to contain the deserialized JSON data, and a method to print the resulting list, but our "controller" method only returns a list of data as opposed to sending it to an actual webpage. The controller for the web app would be simple since we are only getting the model data for our view; no add, update, or delete operations are needed. To build my views, I would use Razor Pages to bring in the model data requested from the controller, and finally render the list of available food trucks on my page in the form of a clean and professionally styled table.
